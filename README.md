# Application-of-F-distribution-on-Fisher's-Iris-Data

A random variable is said to have the F Distribution (named after R.A. Fisher) if its density function is with d1 and d2 degrees of freedom.The applications of f-distribution is widely used in many industries.One of the application is comparison of two variances.
The goal is to obtain the shape of f-distribution.And to know whether the variances of two different data are same,F-distribution is the best tool

The fisherâ€™s iris data is about three flowers,each of the flowers have four types of measurements,namely sepal length,sepal width,petal length and petal width.In this project,the variances of different types of measurements for different flowers are compared.

F-distribution is the distribution which depends on only two parameters,they are d1,d2 degrees of freedom of two different chisquared distribution.If a random variable X has an F-distribution with parameters d1 and d2, we write X ~ F(d1, d2).

A random variable of the F-distribution with parameters d1 and d2 arises as the ratio of two appropriately scaled chi-squared variates
		         F=(U/d1)/(V/d2)
U and V have chi squared distribution with the degrees of  freedom d1 and d2 respectively,The applications of F-distribution are:Testing equality of variances,One way analysis of variance(ANOVA),Regression analysis
